## Project Description  
This project is a fully decentralized task management system deployed on the Flare Network.  
By interacting directly with the blockchain through a smart contract, users can create and manage personal tasks with verifiable timestamps, completion tracking, and immutable history.

The dApp provides a clean and intuitive React/Next.js interface integrated with Wagmi and Viem for seamless wallet-based interaction.

## Features

### **✔ On-Chain Task Creation**  
Users can create new tasks stored permanently on the blockchain.

### **✔ Toggle Task Completion**  
Mark tasks as completed or incomplete. Each status change emits an event and updates the contract state.

### **✔ Task Deletion**  
Tasks can be deleted on-chain, triggering a blockchain event and updating the task list.

### **✔ View All Tasks**  
Retrieve the full list of your tasks, including:
- ID  
- Content  
- Completion status  
- Timestamp  

### **✔ Real-Time UI Synchronization**  
The UI automatically refreshes state after confirmed transactions.

### **✔ Wallet Gating & Secure Access**  
Users must connect a wallet to interact with the contract, ensuring secure task ownership.

### **✔ Full Error Handling & Transaction Feedback**  
Includes:
- Loading indicators  
- Transaction hash display  
- Success confirmation  
- Error reporting

## How It Solves Real Problems

### **Decentralized Ownership**  
Traditional task management apps rely on centralized servers that can lose data or shut down.  
This project leverages blockchain immutability—your tasks persist as long as the network does.

### **Verifiable History & Transparency**  
Tasks hold validated timestamps and event logs, enabling transparent activity tracking without trusting a third party.

### **No Censorship or Deletion by Others**  
Only the wallet owner can modify their data, ensuring full sovereignty over personal productivity tools.

### **Use Cases**
- Personal productivity tracking  
- Immutable time-stamped journals  
- Blockchain-based habit tracking  
- Demonstration of storing structured data on Flare  
- Educational tool for learning Web3 UI integration  

This project showcases how practical everyday apps—such as to-do lists—can be enhanced with decentralized technology, transparency, and user-controlled data storage.
